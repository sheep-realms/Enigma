THE ENIGMA MACHINE IS A CIPHER DEVICE DEVELOPED AND USED IN 
THE EARLY- TO MID-20TH CENTURY TO PROTECT COMMERCIAL, 
DIPLOMATIC, AND MILITARY COMMUNICATION. IT WAS EMPLOYED 
EXTENSIVELY BY NAZI GERMANY DURING WORLD WAR II, IN ALL 
BRANCHES OF THE GERMAN MILITARY. THE ENIGMA MACHINE WAS 
CONSIDERED SO SECURE THAT IT WAS USED TO ENCIPHER THE MOST 
TOP-SECRET MESSAGES.
